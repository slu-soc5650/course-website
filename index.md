### Course Description
This class introduces both the theoretical and technical skills that constitute the nascent field of Geographic Information Science (GISc). Techniques introduced include data cleaning and management, map production and cartography, and the manipulation of both tabular and spatial data. The impact of GISc on public policy, and the effect of public policy on GISc, are also discussed. The course incorporates a wide variety of social, economic, health, urban, and environmental data. These data are mapped at a variety of extents, from individual cities to multi-county regions, all United States counties, and U.S. states themselves. While the examples may be specific to the social sciences, the theories and skills that are covered are broadly applicable across academic disciplines.

### Course Objectives
This course has five intertwined objectives:

  1. *Fundamentals of spatial data*: Describe the concepts and theories that form the foundation of GISc.
  2. *Fundamentals of data management*: Perform basic data cleaning tasks programmatically using Stata, construct geo-databases using ArcCatalog for data organization and storage, and perform basic manipulations of that data using ArcMap.
  3. *Fundamentals of data visualization*: Create and present visualizations of spatial data using ArcMap and Microsoft PowerPoint.
  4. *GISc and Public Policy*: Describe the ways in which public entities support GISc research and the ways in which GISc research supports public policy goals.
  5. *Geospatial research synthesis*: Plan, implement, and present a research project that uses a large, publicly available sociology dataset known as the General Social Survey.

### Core Resources
If you want to learn more about the course, you can check out the core course resources.

The [**Syllabus**](https://github.com/slu-soc5650/Core-Documents/blob/master/syllabus.pdf) sets out core expectations and policies for the course. The [**Reading List**](https://github.com/slu-soc5650/Core-Documents/blob/master/reading-list.pdf) contains topics, readings (both required and optional), and assignment due dates for each week. These two documents spell out what is *required* for this course and are available in the `Core-Documents` repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/slu-soc5650).

The [**User's Guide**](pages/user-guide.html) is a companion document that is written with the aim of helping students be *successful* in this course. The idea behind a course [**User's Guide**](https://slu-soc5650.github.io/User-Guide/index.html) is to create a reference for many of the intangible, subtle or disparate skills and ideas that contribute to being a successful researcher. This is designed to be a living document, and therefore I make it available as part of the [course website](https://slu-soc5650.github.io/User-Guide/index.html). When you open the Users Guide, there is an icon in the top menu-bar that will allow you to download a copy of the document as either a `.pdf` or `.epub` file if you prefer reading in a different format.

Finally, we will use GitHub's [wiki tool](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-wikis/) to maintain a [**Course Wiki**](https://github.com/slu-soc5050/Core-Documents/wiki) throughout the semester. I will use this as a place to post weekly jotters that provide links to more information, descriptions of issues that are arising with particular parts of the course, and course related announcements.
