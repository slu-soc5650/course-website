<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>One of the biggest challenges to with doing computational work is that it requires a high degree of organization. Our approaches to file management on computers are often haphazard, with <code>Documents</code> and <code>Downloads</code> folders filled with disorganized files or a <code>Desktop</code> covered in dozens of files. Perhaps this has worked in the past, but that approach (or lack thereof) <strong>will</strong> fail students in <a href="https://slu-soc5650.github.io" target="_blank">Introduction to Geographic Information Science (SOC <sup>4650</sup>&frasl;<sub>5650</sub>)</a> and <a href="https://slu-soc5050.github.io" target="_blank">Quantitative Analysis: Applied Inferential Statistics (SOC <sup>4930</sup>&frasl;<sub>5050</sub>)</a>. Moreover, if left un-checked, it will fail students down the road when a hard drive failure or natural disaster renders their data irrevocably inaccessible. This chapter covers what some of those threats are and ways to manage those risks when conducting computational research.</p>

<h2 id="threats-to-our-data">Threats To Our Data</h2>

<p>Each semester that I teach <a href="https://slu-soc5650.github.io" target="_blank">Introduction to GIS</a> and <a href="https://slu-soc5050.github.io" target="_blank">Quantitative Analysis</a>, several things happen. The first thing that happens is that students regularly lose files. The effects of losing files can range from being a minor frustration to a major headache depending on the file in question. Losing files often results in downloading multiple copies of the same data and recreating work. Both of these are wastes of your time. Moreover, files are rarely gone. They are typically just misplaced. This is bad for reproducibility, particularly when you happen across multiple versions of the same file and have to sort out which version is the version you last worked on.</p>

<p>The second thing that happens is that students who use thumb drives for data storage lose them. Depending on the timing of this loss, this can again range from being a minor frustration (very early in the semester) to being downright anxiety attack producing (last few weeks of the semester). Recreating an entire semester’s worth of work on the final project is both a tremendous waste of your time and a particularly unpleasant experience.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I have never had a student’s computer hard drive die during the course of the semester. However, I assume that if I teach this course long enough a hard drive failure will indeed occur. The backup provider <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/" target="_blank">Backblaze</a> has <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/how-long-do-disk-drives-last/" target="_blank">analyzed</a> their own hard drives and found that about 5% of drives fail within the first year. After four years, a quarter (25%) of drives in their data center fail. Similarly, it is only a matter of time before a student’s computer is stolen along with all of their hard work. A less likely though still very plausible scenario involves the destruction of a student’s belongings (computer and thumb drive included) in a fire, car accident, or natural disaster.</p>

<p>Despite the likelihood that you will at some-point lose a thumb drive (if not during this semester than sometime down the road) and the near certainty that your computer’s hard drive will eventually fail if a rogue wave does not get it first, few students and faculty take these risks seriously. While you cannot prevent many of these things from happening, I want to suggest to you that you can take some simple steps to sure that <em>when</em> (not if) they happen, you are well prepared to get back to work with minimal disruption.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-sustainable-file-system">Creating a Sustainable File System</h2>

<p>The first thing that students can do to stave off problems with lost files is to actively and mindfully manage their files. In his excellent document <a href="http://plain-text.co" target="_blank"><em>The Plain Person’s Guide to Plain Text Social Science</em></a>, Kieran Healy describes two important revolutions in computing that are currently taking place. One of them is the advent of mobile touch-screen devices, which he notes</p>

<blockquote>
<p>hide from the user both the workings of the operating system and (especially) the structure of the file system where items are stored and moved around.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For most users, I would argue that this extends to their laptop or desktop computers as well. I would venture to guess that the majority of my students are used to keeping large numbers of files on their desktops or in an (distressingly) disorganized <code>Documents</code> folder. For research, particularly quantitative research, such an approach to file management is unsustainable. It is difficult to produce <em>any</em> research, let alone work that is reproducible, without an active and mindful approach to file management.</p>

<h3 id="create-a-single-course-directory">Create a <em>Single</em> Course Directory</h3>

<p>The most successful approach to organizing files is to identify <em>one and only one</em> area that you will store course files in. Having files scattered around you hard drive between you <code>Desktop</code> directory, <code>Downloads</code>, <code>Documents</code>, and a half dozen other places is a recipe for lost files. It can also add complexity to the task of backing these files up. I recommend naming this directory simply based on the course you are enrolled in:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>SOC4650</code></li>
<li><code>SOC4930</code></li>
<li><code>SOC5050</code></li>
<li><code>SOC5650</code></li>
</ul>

<p>These names are short, have no punctuation or spaces (which can create conflicts with software), and explicitly connects the directory to this course as opposed to other courses you may take that are also statistics or GIS courses (a good reason to avoid naming the directory <code>Stats</code> or <code>GIS</code>!).</p>

<p>This single course directory should reside in <em>one and only one</em> place. Once you have these folders set-up, I want you to an agreement with yourself: files for the course will <em>only</em> be saved within this structure. Do not temporarily save files to the <code>Desktop</code>, for example, intending to move them later. They will be forgotten. Like New Years resolutions, it is easy to say that you will use a file system but difficult to maintain that promise when stress sets in or you are rushed. Do <em>everything</em> you can to maintain your file system.</p>

<h3 id="storing-the-course-directory">Storing the Course Directory</h3>

<p>Storing this directory inside a sync&rsquo;d directory (like Dropbox or Google Drive) may cause conflicts with your Git repositories. Instead, students for both of my courses should utilize a large sized thumb drive or an external hard drive for data storage (see the &ldquo;Course Onboarding&rdquo; section of the respective course&rsquo;s website for additional details). Having data stored on an external device raises the risk of physical loss, but also makes it easier to move work between different computers. This is particularly challenging for GI Science work, where spatial data sources can be may megabytes in size.</p>

<p>macOS users should make sure that the external drive is formatted using the ExFat file system specification so that it is readable both by their operating system and the Windows operating system in the computer lab. If you buy a new drive, you will likely have to re-format it. Directions for doing so are <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/PH22241?locale=en_US" target="_blank">available from Apple</a>.</p>

<h3 id="approach-organizing-systematically">Approach Organizing Systematically</h3>

<p>Within your single course directory, I recommend following a mindful, purposeful approach to organization. This approach begins with having a number of dedicated subfolders within your course directory:</p>

<pre><code>/SOC5650
  /Core-Documents
  /DataLibrary
  /DoeAssignments
  /Lectures

<p>Note again how these directories are named - there are no spaces, special characters, and the names are deliberately short but specific. For a directory with two words (e.g. <code>DataLibrary</code>), I use what is known as camelCase to name the file where the second (any any subsequent) words have their first character capitalized. You could also use dash-case (e.g. <code>Core-Documents</code>) or snake_case (e.g. <code>Core_Documents</code>) as a naming strategy. Regardless of which of these approaches you take, try to use it consistently.</p>

<p>For both of the courses that I teach, a basic file system will be made available for download onto your external device. See the respective course websites for more information about course data releases. Only the data release for <a href="https://slu-soc5650.github.io" target="_blank">Introduction to Geographic Information Science (SOC <sup>4650</sup>&frasl;<sub>5650</sub>)</a> will contain a <code>DataLibrary</code> directory.</p>

<h3 id="the-core-documents-directory">The <code>Core-Documents</code> Directory</h3>

<p>The <code>Core-Documents</code> directory is used for storing the course syllabus, reading list, and a sample schedule for 3600 Morrissey Hall for the semester. You can view it online for both <a href="https://github.com/slu-soc5050/Core-Documents" target="_blank">Introduction to GIS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/slu-soc5650/Core-Documents" target="_blank">Quanitative Analysis</a>. Once we cover using Git and GitHub in class, you should <strong>clone</strong> the appropriate <code>Core-Documents</code> repository into your file system. If there are updates, you will want to make sure you <strong>pull</strong> them down onto your local copy of the repository. You can read ahead in the [Basic Git] chapter for more information on how this works.</p>

<p>You will not be able to <strong>push</strong> changes that you make in this directory to GitHub, and making other changes could cause conflicts. I suggest not making changes inside this repository beyond opening files for reference purposes.</p>

<h3 id="the-datalibrary-directory">The <code>DataLibrary</code> Directory</h3>

<p>This directory is only applicable to students in <a href="https://slu-soc5650.github.io" target="_blank">Introduction to GIS</a>, whose data release will contain it. It will have copies of most data not disseminated to you as <code>R</code> packages. The data in this directory should be used as needed but not altered (one of the of the [&ldquo;Good Enough&rdquo; Research Practices] from the next chapter).</p>

<h3 id="the-doeassignments-directory">The <code>DoeAssignments</code> Directory</h3>

<p>Like the <code>Core-Documents</code> repository, this will not be included in the course data release. Once we cover using Git and GitHub in class, you should <strong>clone</strong> the appropriate <code>Core-Documents</code> repository into your file system. It will also have a different name - your last name instead of &lsquo;Doe&rsquo;. Once you add it, it will contain a number of subdirectories:</p>

<pre><code>  /SOC5650
    /DoeAssignments
      /FinalProject

      /Labs
        /Lab-01
        ...
        /Lab-15

      /LecturePreps
        /LP-01
        ...
        /LP-15
        
      /ProblemSets
        /PS-01
        ...
        /PS-08
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>FinalProject</code> directory will not have any subfolders in it. You will be asked to populate it with the appropriate subdirectories (see [Organizing Projects] below). These will be detailed in the final project instructions. The <code>Labs</code>, <code>LecturePreps</code>, and <code>ProblemSets</code> subdirectories have folders dedicated to the individual assignments you&rsquo;ll have to submit over the course of the semester. Like the <code>FinalProject</code> directory, you will need to populate them with the appropriate deliverables. These will be detailed in each assignment&rsquo;s instructions.</p>

<h3 id="the-lectures-directory">The <code>Lectures</code> Directory</h3>

<p>This directory should contain subfolders for each of the sixteen weeks of the course.</p>

<pre><code>  /SOC5650
    /Lectures
      /Lecture-01
      ...
      /Lecture-16
</code></pre>

<p>You will need to add these subfolders each week by <strong>cloning</strong> them from GitHub.com. You will not be able to push changes that you make in these directories to GitHub, and making other changes could cause conflicts. I suggest not making changes inside this repository beyond opening files for reference purposes. If there is something you need to edit, copy it to the appropriate subdirectory of <code>DoeAssignments</code> and make your changes there.</p>

<h3 id="the-notes-directory">The <code>Notes</code> Directory</h3>

<p>Use this as a home for course notes if you decide to take notes digitally and do not already use notebook software of some kind that organizes notes for you.</p>

<h3 id="the-readings-directory">The <code>Readings</code> Directory</h3>

<p>Use this as a home for <code>.pdf</code> copies of course readings. I suggest creating subdirectories <em>only</em> for weeks that have readings assigned from outside of the main texts, such as Lecture 01:</p>

<pre><code>  /SOC5650
    /Readings
      /Lecture-01
</code></pre>

<h2 id="organizing-projects">Organizing Projects</h2>

<p>Following the excellent article <a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510" target="_blank"><em>Good enough practices in scientific computing</em></a> (Wilson et al. 2017), I suggest data science projects should be organized in a specific, standardized way. This approach serves much the same purpose as the previous section on [Creating a Sustainable File System] - work that is well organized is better insured against loss.</p>

<h3 id="a-sample-project">A Sample Project</h3>

<p>Much as I suggested above that course files reside in one and only one place, projects should be organized similarly (with one important caveat below). What follows is a sample project and then descriptions of each element. More details about each folder (excepting <code>maps</code>) can be found in the article. The project below contains all of key elements of a small geospatial research project:</p>

<pre><code>  /projectName
    /data
      rawData.csv
      rawTracts.shp
    /doc
      joinedTracts.md
      notebook.Rmd
      notebook.nb.html
      researchLog.md
    /maps
      map.mxd
    /results
      joinedTracts.shp
      map.png
    /src
      script.R
    LICENSE.md
    projectName.Rproj
    README.md
</code></pre>

<h3 id="top-level-files">Top-Level Files</h3>

<p>At least two files should be present in each project directory - a <code>README.md</code> and a <code>LICENSE.md</code>. As I noted in the previous chapter, both of these files should be plain-text files. Typically, they are formatted using [Markdown] syntax The <code>README</code> should describe your project, detail any key dependencies or outside data sources that might be required, and provide other important details like how to cite your project and what other online resources might be available.</p>

<p>The <code>LICENSE</code> is a key element of open source research. This spells out how others may use (and not use) your work. The excellent guide <a href="https://opensource.guide/" target="_blank">The Legal Side of Open Source</a> notes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Open source is an unusual circumstance&hellip;because the author expects that others will use, modify, and share the work. But because the legal default is still exclusive copyright, you need a license that explicitly states these permissions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are lots of different options for open source licenses, and <a href="https://choosealicense.com" target="_blank">GitHub&rsquo;s choose a license site</a> does a great job of explaining some of the <a href="https://choosealicense.com/appendix/" target="_blank">many options</a>. In the <code>R</code> community, many packages are made available using the <a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/" target="_blank">MIT</a> or <a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/" target="_blank">GNU GPLv3</a> licenses. For written content, presentations, and other non-code works, the Creative Commons <a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc-by-4.0/" target="_blank">Attribution</a> and <a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc-by-sa-4.0/" target="_blank">Attribution-ShareAlike</a> licenses are both common options. For data, the <a href="https://opendatacommons.org" target="_blank">Open Data Commons</a> licenses are not discussed on GitHub&rsquo;s site but are options for data-specific licenses. Finally, large projects sometimes require <a href="https://choosealicense.com/non-software/" target="_blank">multiple licenses</a>. If you use a data-specific, code-specific, and/or content-specific mix of licenses, be sure to describe in the <code>README</code> which license applies to which element of of the project. Licensing your projects is another form of protecting your work. If these projects are out in the open, licensing ensures that your work will be used under terms that you are comfortable with.</p>

<p>If the project uses <code>R</code>, an <code>R</code> project file (<code>.Rproj</code>) should also be saved in the top-level of the project. This will facilitate the top-level folder being set automatically as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_directory" target="_blank">working directory</a>. The working directory is the folder that <code>R</code> will open data from and save data to by default.</p>

<h3 id="the-data-directory">The <code>data</code> Directory</h3>

<p>All data sources, with a few exceptions, should be stored here. For instance, in the example above, a tabular data source and a raw shapefile are both used as part of the project. There are, however, a number of exceptions to this. One exception is data that has been packaged in an <code>R</code> package. For example, I have packaged a large set of tables containing historical census data to make them easier to work with. When these are used in projects, I do not save the tables in the <code>data</code> folder. Rather, I make reference to them in the <code>README</code> file and in other project documents.</p>

<p>A second exception is for large geospatial data libraries, like the data release for my <a href="https://slu-soc5650.github.io" target="_blank">Introduction to GIS</a>. Given the size of these files, it is sometimes impractical to reproduce them multiple times across different projects. Clearly noting that specific files are stored on local libraries available elsewhere in the <code>README</code> file and in other project documents is also an acceptable alternative here.</p>

<h3 id="the-doc-directory">The <code>doc</code> Directory</h3>

<p>The <code>doc</code> directory should be used for all text documents associated with the project. These might include metadata associated with different project data files, an interactive <code>R</code> notebook, a research log file, and article manuscripts. If needed, subdirectories within <code>doc</code> should be used to keep different files organized. In the example above, <code>joinedTracts.md</code> is the metadata for the similarly named shapefile in the <code>data</code> subdirectory. The <code>notebook</code> files are the interactive <code>R</code> notebook and its associated <code>html</code> output. Finally, the <code>researchLog.md</code> is used for tracking higher level progress over the course of the project.</p>

<h3 id="the-maps-directory">The <code>maps</code> Directory</h3>

<p><code>maps</code> is a deviation from <a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510" target="_blank"><em>Good enough practices in scientific computing</em></a> (Wilson et al. 2017), which does not envision some of the complexity of working with geospatial data. It should be used for storing the <code>.mxd</code> files from ArcGIS projects or the equivalent QGIS files if that application is being used instead. Illustrator files used for post-processing work should also be stored here if used. Remember that these files should be saved using relative paths to link them to data sources to limit the possibility of conflicts down the road.</p>

<h3 id="the-results-directory">The <code>results</code> Directory</h3>

<p>The <code>results</code> directory should contain any data outputs, plots, and map images. These might include intermediate and final versions of data sets as well as shapefiles and GeoJSON files created as part of the analysis process. In the example above, a shapefile combining both of the raw data sources named <code>joinedTracts.shp</code> is saved here along with the exported map image from the map file in the <code>maps</code> subdirectory. Depending on the complexity of the project, subdirectories within <code>results</code> might be necessary.</p>

<h3 id="the-src-directory">The <code>src</code> Directory</h3>

<p>For projects that rely on functions not included in packages, for example, or that rely on other pre-made scripts, the <code>src</code> subdirectory should be used for storing script files that are called by notebooks in <code>doc</code>.</p>

<h3 id="storing-your-project">Storing Your Project</h3>

<p>There are a number of places where work can be deposited. I teach all students in my classes how to use <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub.com</a> because it integrates directly into version control software, which I see as a critical component of [&ldquo;Good Enough&rdquo; Research Practices]. There are other options, however. For larger projects that may not just be on GitHub (see [Basic Git]) but also utilize a collaborative writing space like Google Docs, the <a href="https://osf.io" target="_blank">Open Science Framework</a> is an excellent tool. It allows for an even wider set of version control tools to be applied to projects and can be used to organize work that is not easily stored on GitHub, like large number of pdf articles, for which version control is not critical.</p>

<p>Once a research project has begun dissemination, repositories like <a href="https://zenodo.org" target="_blank">Zenodo</a> and <a href="https://figshare.com" target="_blank">Figshare</a> are designed to make open source data and project materials accessible and citeable. For papers specifically, there are a number of discipline specific archives for pre-prints of papers. Many journals will allow pre-prints to remain freely available even after more formal publication. The original pre-print archive, <a href="https://arxiv.org" target="_blank">arXiv</a>, is focused on the STEM sciences and has inspired a number of spinoffs. Many of these are supported by the <a href="https://cos.io" target="_blank">Center for Open Science</a>, the same organization that operates the <a href="https://osf.io" target="_blank">Open Science Framework</a> tool described above. For social scientists, <a href="https://socopen.org/welcome/" target="_blank">SocArXiv</a> is a growing pre-print repository that is part of the <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv" target="_blank">Center for Open Science&rsquo;s pre-print network</a>.</p>

<h3 id="organizing-coursework">Organizing Coursework</h3>

<p>For <a href="https://slu-soc5650.github.io" target="_blank">Introduction to Geographic Information Science (SOC <sup>4650</sup>&frasl;<sub>5650</sub>)</a> and <a href="https://slu-soc5050.github.io" target="_blank">Quantitative Analysis: Applied Inferential Statistics (SOC <sup>4930</sup>&frasl;<sub>5050</sub>)</a>, problem sets and the final project should both be organized following the general template above.</p>

<h2 id="backing-up-your-data">Backing Up Your Data</h2>

<p>All of the organization in the world cannot prevent a computer hard drive from failing or a natural disaster from destroying your hardware. Similarly, even the best organized of us lose things sometimes or accidentally delete files. Backing up files is therefore a critical piece of not just doing computational work but, in this day and age, it is a requisite skill for owning computer hardware. Every device you own including your phone can and should be backed up. There are a number of different ways to think about backing up your data. The most successful backup strategies will incorporate all of these three elements.</p>

<h3 id="bootable-backups">Bootable Backups</h3>

<p>“Bootable” backups are mirrored images of your <em>entire</em> hard drive, down to temporary files, icons, and system files. With a bootable backup, you can restore your entire computer in the event of a hard drive failure or a corruption of the operating system files. They are named as such because you can plug in the external drive that you are using for this backup and literally boot your computer up from that drive (typically a <em>very</em> slow process).</p>

<p>These backups are often made less frequently because they can be resource intensive and it is best not to use your operating system while creating a clone. They are typically made to an external hard drive, which is subject to similar failure rates as the hard drives inside your computer. So bootable drives need to be replaced every few years to maintain their reliability.</p>

<p>Both major operating systems come with applications for creating clones of your main hard drive that are bootable, and there are a number of third party applications that provide this service as well.</p>

<h3 id="incremental-backups">Incremental Backups</h3>

<p>Incremental backups are designed to keep multiple copies of a single file (how often depends on the type of software you use and the settings you select). These can be used to restore an older copy of a file if work is lost or a newer file is corrupted.</p>

<p>Apple’s TimeMachine is a great example of an incremental backup - when kept on, it creates hourly backups of files that have been changed, daily backups for the previous month, and weekly backups for previous months. Once the disk is full, the oldest backups are deleted. Dropbox also provides a similar service, retaining all previous versions of files (and deleted files) for thirty days.</p>

<p>Incremental backups are typically good options for recovering files that have been recently changed (again, depending on the software you use and the settings you select). Since they run frequently (every time a file is changed or every hour, for example), recent changes tend to get captured. They can be limited in terms of their long-term storage - it may not be possible to recover older versions of a file past a few weeks.</p>

<p>They are also not always good solutions for recreating your entire computer since they do not save all necessary program and operating system files, and may be cumbersome to work with if you need to recover a large quantity of files. Like bootable backups, these are typically stored on external hard drives that need to be replaced on a regular basis.</p>

<p>In addition to the aforementioned Apple TimeMachine, the Windows OS also comes with a built-in service for creating incremental backups. Dropbox is a good option if you have a small number of files, but you may find the need to upgrade to a paid account if you have a large amount of data.</p>

<h3 id="cloud-backups">Cloud Backups</h3>

<p>Cloud backup services like <a href="https://www.backblaze.com" target="_blank">Backblaze</a> or <a href="https://www.code42.com/crashplan/" target="_blank">Crashplan</a> offer comprehensive backup solutions for customers. These plans typically require a monthly subscription fee to maintain access to your backups. While bootable backups protect against hard drive failure and incremental backups protect against data corruption, cloud backups protect against catastrophic events like robberies, fires, and other natural disasters. A fire or a tornado that affect your house may destroy your laptop and any external hard drives you use for backup, but your cloud backup will be unaffected.</p>

<h3 id="a-workflow-for-backups">A Workflow for Backups</h3>

<p>Just as we need a workflow for approaching file management, it is also important to establish a routine for backups. With backups, the most successful workflows are those that require next to no effort on your part. If you primarily use a desktop, this can be as simple as leaving two external hard drives plugged into your computer since most backup software can be set to run automatically. If you have tasks that require you to manually do something (plug an external hard drive into your computer, for instance), create a reminder for yourself on a paper calendar or a digital calendar or to-do list application.</p>

<div class="alert alert-note">
  <p>I gave a presentation on workflows for backing data up as part of the <a href="https://slu-dss.github.io" target="_blank">Data Science Seminar</a> series at <a href="https://slu.edu" target="_blank">Saint Louis University</a>. You can easily view the slides from that presentation on <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/chrisprener/protecting-your-data" target="_blank">Speaker Deck</a>, and you can download the session&rsquo;s materials from <a href="https://github.com/slu-dss/protectData" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

</div>


<p>For this course in particular, it is <em>imperative</em> that you backup the data on your flash drive. A number of possibilities exist for accomplishing this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Keep a local copy of your flash drive&rsquo;s files on your computer.</li>
<li>Keep a <code>.zip</code> archive of your files in a service like Dropbox or Google Drive. (Using a <code>.zip</code> archive will prevent issues with your <code>.git</code> repositories.)</li>
<li>Maintain a second flash drive copies of all of your files.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whatever solution you select, make sure you regularly update your backup. The more often you keep your backup archive updated, the less stressful and disruptive losing your drive will be. This will likely be a manual task, so follow the guidance above about creating a repeating calendar event or to-do list task reminder.</p>
