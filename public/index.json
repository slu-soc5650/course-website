Their material needs to be completed before the beginning of the semester. The Course Software page also can be used if you decide to set-up the course software on your own computer midway through the semester or have to set-up a new computer.\nFundamentals These reference pages cover materials that don\u0026rsquo;t typically show up in textbooks. They\u0026rsquo;ll be assigned as required readings over the first few weeks of the semester. They also serve as good references as the semester progresses and you find yourself needing reminders about certain basic skills like Markdown or how to format an .Rmd file for this course.\nLectures Each lecture has a page here that includes the primary topics, links to resources, an embedded slide deck, and (sometimes) additional notes about the material covered that day.\nProject This is a landing page with links to final project resources, data, instructions, and a list of the final project due dates.\nTopics There are two indicies included in this section - a listing of all of the topic keywords, ArcGIS processes, and R functions that we cover throughout the semester and a listing of R packages used (with links to documentation and resources).\n","date":1543903200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1543903200,"objectID":"4cdd37113783e47641dd300543c94e1b","permalink":"/docs/","publishdate":"2018-12-04T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/docs/","section":"docs","summary":"Elements of the course are under revision for Spring 2019.

All of the applicable sections below should be completed before our first class on January 14th. Before you do anything else, though, you should read through the Syllabus. Make sure you have a good sense of what is required for the course. If you have questions, bring them to the first day of class!\nAccount Signups Get Started with Discourse TBA\nGet Started with GitHub The service that is hosting this website is called GitHub. GitHub is used by programmers, data scientists, and researchers for hosting computer code, data, and project materials (like websites). We will be using GitHub extensively this semester. You will need a free account, which you can sign up for one from GitHub\u0026rsquo;s homepage. If you already have a GitHub account, you do not need a new one.\nOnce you have a GitHub user name, send Chris a Direct Message via our Discourse site with it so that you can be added to the SOC 4650 \u0026amp; SOC 5650 organization. After you have been added to the organization, you should find your assignments repository and check the Issues tab. There should be an open Issue describing how feedback will be disseminated this semester. Please read it and then close the issue so that we know you\u0026rsquo;ve seen it.\nCourse Software There are two options for accessing the course software, and some instructions for how install it. Please read through these options carefully and make the decision that is best for you.\nOptions for Accessing Software One option is to rely on the computers in our classroom, and - lucky you(!) - you get 24-hour access to Morrissey Hall for the semester. If you decide to go this route, you can go right to the course software page to continue setting up your computer - you\u0026rsquo;ll need to install just the specific R packages and GitHub Desktop. Details on the extent of setup required will be posted there since it is subject to change. Make sure you know how to use Windows File Explorer, especially if you are a regular macOS user.\nAnother option for accessing the software is to use your own computer. If you decide to go this route, please read the next subsection on computer prep, and then head over to the course software page to continue setting up your computer. As long as you have a relatively new computer (within the last few years), you should have no problem using any of the applications for this class.\nComputer Prep If you are using your own computer, you should do the following before proceeding:\n Make sure your operating system is up-to-date. If you are able, I would also recommend upgrading your computer to the most recent release of its operating system that the computer can run.\n On macOS, you can do this through the App Store Both Windows 7 and Windows 10 have system update tools.  We\u0026rsquo;ll be sharing computer files throughout the semester, so you should ensure that you have functioning anti-virus software and that it is up-to-date. You can get Symantec EndPoint Protection anti-virus software for free from SLU. Go to \u0026ldquo;ITS Software Downloads\u0026rdquo; under \u0026ldquo;Tools\u0026rdquo; on mySLU.\n You\u0026rsquo;ll also need to download files, so you\u0026rsquo;ll need to make sure you have at least forty gigabytes free on your hard drive if you are installing ArcGIS Pro and at least fifteen gigabytes free if you are not. If you\u0026rsquo;re not sure how to check this, here are some instructions for Windows and macOS\n Options for de-cluttering include deleting files that are no longer needed, moving files to an external device, moving files to a cloud storage system, or upgrading the internal hard drive (may not be possible for macOS users and some Windows users).  Make sure you know how to access your computer\u0026rsquo;s file management system.\n On macOS, this means being comfortable with Finder.app for finding folders, making new ones, and opening files. Here are some tips for using Finder on recent versions of macOS. On Windows, this means being comfortable with Windows File Explorer for finding folders, making new ones, and opening files. Here are some tips for using File Explorer on Windows 7 or Windows 10.  Head over to the course software page to continue setting up your computer.\n  Get Access to Books There are a number of different books required for this course. Each book has been selected to correspond with one or more of the course objectives. Please purchase copies of the first three books and decide if you would like a physical copy of the fourth:\n Brewer, Cynthia. 2015. Designing better Maps: A Guide for GIS users. Redlands, CA: ESRI Press. Gorr, Wilpen and Kristen Kurland. 2017. GIS Tutorial 1 for ArcGIS Pro. Redlands, CA: ESRI Press. Wickham, Hadley and Garrett Grolemund. 2016. R for data science. Sebastopol, CA: O’Reilly. Webbook Available.  All of the books are available in the bookstore. They can also be ordered online. If you would rather use e-books, those are acceptable for this course as well. The Reading List includes the assigned readings for both the web and print versions of Wickham and Grolemund\u0026rsquo;s R for data science (2016), and you are free to choose either version.\nOther Materials The other item to purchase is a 1.5\u0026rdquo; three-ring binder (like high school! extra points for a Trapper Keeper!!). While all course materials are available online, they are often easier to use if they are printed. Each week you\u0026rsquo;ll receive various handouts, including (typically) cheat sheets for R functions and ArcGIS processes, an illustration of the workflow we are focused on, the lab, and the problem set. The handouts are designed with generous margins to facilitate note-taking on them, and they\u0026rsquo;ll be distributed with holes already punched in them. Keeping these in a three-ring binder will help you refer back to your notes at a later date. You should also purchase dividers, either 16 (one for each week) or 8 (if you want to organize handouts by categories).\nAdministrative Tasks All students should complete the [Student Information Sheet](), which gives me some info about you and gives you the chance to let me know about any initial concerns you might have. It also contains a syllabus agreement, which confirms that you have read the Syllabus and understand the course policies.\nCoursework There are three pieces of coursework that you should complete:\n You should view two videos posted on the Course Preview page and check out the interactive map discussed in the first video. You should complete Lecture-01 Entry Ticket, which asks a few short questions about the videos and interactive map. You should complete the assigned readings for Lecture-01, which are listed in the Syllabus and are available either through electronic reserves site or through the Course Docs.

Much of the data that we will use this semseter is available to us because governmental agencies at the Federal, state, and local levels have published it and made it accessible. We call the movement to make as much data available as possible \u0026ldquo;open data\u0026rdquo;.\nDifferent governments have embraced the open data movement to varying degrees, and the video below discusses Los Angeles\u0026rsquo; integration of open data and GIS. It is a 9 minute talk given by L.A.\u0026rsquo;s former Chief Data Officer Lilian P. Coral. The talk was part of a conference organized by ESRI, the makers of ArcGIS.\n    Once you\u0026rsquo;ve watched the video, check out the web application featured in the video that visualizes pedestrian and cyclist injuries in Los Angeles. You can also visit L.A.\u0026rsquo;s open data website called GeoHub.\nAnalysis Development Making a produce like L.A.\u0026rsquo;s visualization of pedestrian and cyclist injuries is a complicated effort. Data must be obtained from various sources, modified (a process we call \u0026ldquo;data wrangling\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;data clearning\u0026rdquo;), and then linked with map coordinates. Once it is ready to be mapped, the web application must be designed and created. We\u0026rsquo;ll call this large-scale process a \u0026ldquo;workflow\u0026rdquo; this semester.\nThe workflow that we\u0026rsquo;ll use is opinionated - there is a strong premise that underlies the workflow about the ways in which spatial data (and data more generally) should be obtained, stored, modified, and mapped. Hilary Parker is a data scientist at Stichfix and also runs a data science podcast called Not So Standard Deviations. She has been speaking recently about an idea called opionated analysis development. The video linked to below is a 25 minute talk she gave on this idea last year, and she now has a draft paper out on the topic as well. Our workflow for this semester is closely linked to the ideas she discusses in this talk.\n\n Many (but not all of you) will have experienced some parts of these processes before. Perhaps you\u0026rsquo;ve used Microsoft Excel to organize some information or used SPSS to analyze some quantitative data. We won\u0026rsquo;t be using those tools. Instead, this course will emphasize the use of other tools that support reproducibile, accurate, and collaborative data analysis. Thoughout the semester, we\u0026rsquo;ll discuss why these tools are important and the advantages they have over other products that are out there. Inspired by Hilary\u0026rsquo;s idea of opinionated analysis development, our goal each week will be to focus on the processes that can be used to increase the reproducibility and accuracy of our geospatial work.\nLecture-01 Entry Ticket The entry ticket for the first lecture asks three follow-up questions about these videos and L.A.\u0026rsquo;s interactive website. Please answer these questions and submit them before class on January 14th. Answers must be submitted through Google Forms and each response should be three to four sentances in length. The questions are provided here for reference:\n Briefly describe how the City of Los Angeles uses data and mapping to inform how they deliver city services. After viewing the interactive map showing pedestrian and cyclist injuries, describe what you thought of the map. Some example considerations could include: was it easy to read? to navigate? did you like the colors? was it missing relevant data? In your own words, what are the key aspects of opinionated analysis development?  The entry ticket also asks for an update on your course onboarding process.\n","date":1543903200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543903200,"objectID":"f5d8021a03a81b574899ba6dff3b2e4f","permalink":"/docs/course-preview/","publishdate":"2018-12-04T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/docs/course-preview/","section":"docs","summary":"Meta \u0026nbsp; Spring 2019  \u0026nbsp; Draft  \u0026nbsp; 2018-12-04 \nKey Topics \u0026nbsp; Analysis development \u0026nbsp; Interactive maps \u0026nbsp; Open data \u0026nbsp; Reproducibility\nOpen Data and GIS in Los Angeles One of the course learning outcomes is titled \u0026ldquo;GISc and Public Policy\u0026rdquo;.

As I noted on the course onboarding page, there are two choices for accessing software. Please read through the course onboarding page page carefully and make the decisions you think are best for you - either using your own computer or using a lab computer. Feel free to shoot me an email if you have questions about which approach is best.\nArcGIS Pro ArcGIS Pro is installed in the GIS lab.\n I am able to provide licenses for ArcGIS Pro to students who are interested in obtaining them. If you would like a license, please check the system requirements first. If your computer meets the minimum requirements, email me for a license. Then:\n Visit ESRI\u0026rsquo;s education edition website to begin the process of activating and downloading your ArcGIS Pro Student Trial software. Log in using your Existing Esri account (the same one you were given during the course onboarding process). Enter the license code and click Activate ArcGIS. Click the button for the ArcGIS for Desktop software version being activated - the latest version of ArcGIS Pro. If necessary, download the ArcGIS Uninstall Utility and uninstall previous versions of ArcGIS Desktop or ArcGIS Pro. Run the executable file that you downloaded to install ArcGIS Pro.  Spatial Libraries These libraries are installed in the GIS lab.\n There are three open-source spatial libraries that we will indirectly use this semester - GDAL, GEOS, and PROJ.4. They\u0026rsquo;ll be used by the R package sf.\nWindows To install the libraries on Windows, you need to have RTools installed. RTools is a suite of tools for building packages on Windows, and it will allow sf to install a number of spatial data libraries that it requires to read and process shapefiles. These tools require administrative rights, so you may have to enter your password.\nmacOS Users on macOS will have to install the spatial data libraries on their own. An omnibus installer is available from the Kyng Chaos website - you\u0026rsquo;ll want to download and run the GDAL 2.2 Complete installer.\nR Installing Base R Base R is installed in the GIS lab.\n You can download R from its website. Choose \u0026ldquo;Download R for (Mac) OS X\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Download R for Windows\u0026rdquo;. Windows users should look for text that says \u0026ldquo;install R for the first time\u0026rdquo; and click the base to the left of that text. Both macOS and Windows users should install R version 3.5.1, known as \u0026ldquo;Feather Spray\u0026rdquo;.\nIf you already have R installed, please make sure you have the latest version. You can upgrade it using the same process for a new installation.\nInstalling R Packages R packages will need be installed both in the lab and on personal computers.\n There are a number of R packages that you will need for this semester. If you feel feel comfortable, go ahead and take care of this before the semester starts. If not, we\u0026rsquo;ll go over how to do this type of installation on the first day of class!\nThe following code snipped can be pasted into your R console to install all of these required packages.\ninstall.packages(c(\u0026quot;tidyverse\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;janitor\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;sf\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;stldata\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;testDriveR\u0026quot;))  Depending on your version of R and your operating system, there will be other dependencies that are required and the number of packages installed will be considerably larger. The installation process has not been extensively tested on different operating system and hardware configurations, and though it is unlikely, you may encounter issues. If you do, please let Chris know!\nRStudio RStudio is installed in the GIS lab.\n RStudio is a graphical user interface for R that will make learning the language and using it much, much easier. You should download the free version of RStudio from their website. Choose the appropriate installer for your platform. Make sure R is already installed before installing RStudio.\nIf you already have RStudio installed, please make sure you have the latest version. You can upgrade it using the same process for a new installation.\nGitHub Desktop GitHub Desktop will need be installed both in the lab and on personal computers.\n In addition to the applications above, everyone will need a local installation of GitHub Desktop, which is a graphical user interface for accessing Git and GitHub.com. It can be downloaded for free from the application\u0026rsquo;s website. You will need to download and run the installer. Once it is complete, you will need to login to the application with your GitHub.com username and password.\nIf you already have GitHub Desktop installed, you should check to make sure you are running the latest version of GitHub Desktop. If you need to update GitHub Desktop, you should also download.\nOther Applications You can download mobile apps for our forum software, Discourse, for both iOS and Android devices.\n","date":1543903200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543903200,"objectID":"4d35c06a94fe58298d2af432933711bc","permalink":"/docs/course-software/","publishdate":"2018-12-04T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/docs/course-software/","section":"docs","summary":"Meta \u0026nbsp; Spring 2019  \u0026nbsp; Draft  \u0026nbsp; 2018-12-04 \nOverview This course is built primarily around a set of four software applications - ArcGIS Pro, the programming language R, the graphical user interface for R called RStudio, and GitHub Desktop.

Markup languages are used to give computer programs directions on how particular blocks of text should be processed. Markdown was developed in 2004 by writer and developer John Gruber. Gruber describes Markdown on his website:\n Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.\nReadability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters — including Setext, atx, Textile, reStructuredText, Grutatext, and EtText — the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email.\nTo this end, Markdown’s syntax is comprised entirely of punctuation characters, which punctuation characters have been carefully chosen so as to look like what they mean. E.g., asterisks around a word actually look like emphasis. Markdown lists look like, well, lists. Even blockquotes look like quoted passages of text, assuming you’ve ever used email\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;Markdown’s syntax is intended for one purpose: to be used as a format for writing for the web. Markdown is utilized to varying degrees by many of the data science tools we\u0026rsquo;ll use in both courses, including RStudio, GitHub, and Slack. In all three applications, Markdown provides a straightforward way to format and stylize plain text files. Markdown therefore gives us the best of two worlds - text files can be organized and formatted as in WYSIWYG editors like Microsoft Word, but they remain plain text files that are accessible in a variety of computing environments and do not depend on proprietary applications.\n Markdown\u0026rsquo;s simplicity is sometimes also identified as a weakness - it lacks the full fledged control of html or LaTeX, for example. However, for research documentation, the bells, whistles, and fine-grained control of something like LaTeX are unnecessary. Long-term portability is a far more important characteristic, and Markdown excels in this area.\nMarkdown files are really just plain-text files, which are usually identified as .txt files. However, when they contain Markdown syntax, we want to name them as .md files. Most applications will continue to recognize .md files as plain-text files. However, certain desktop applications like RStudio and some websites like GitHub.com recognize the .md file extension and will \u0026ldquo;render\u0026rdquo; the Markdown syntax into formatted output. When you create Markdown files in an application like RStudio, make sure to save them with the .md file extension!\nDocument Organization There are two principle means for organizing Markdown documents - headings of varying size and paragraph breaks.\nHeadings Markdown contains six heading levels. Headings are identified with # symbols and a space that separates them from from the heading text.\nInput:\n# This is the largest heading ## This is the second largest heading ### This is the third largest heading #### This is the fourth largest heading #### This is the second smallest heading ###### This is the smallest heading  Output:\nNew Paragraphs Leave a blank line between two paragraphs to create a break.\nInput:\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Previous work can be computationally intensive and is mainly based on low-level cues extracted from RGB data and implemented on a PC for a fixed sensor network (such as traditional CCTV). We present a practical and efficient framework for mobile devices (such as smart phones and robots) where high-level semantic soft biometrics are extracted from RGB and depth data. By combining these cues, our approach attempts to provide robustness to noise, illumination, and minor variations in clothing. This mobile approach may be particularly useful for the identification of persons in areas ill-served by fixed sensors or for tasks where the sensor position and direction need to dynamically adapt to a target. Results on the BIWI dataset are preliminary but encouraging. Further evaluation and demonstration of the system will be available on our website.","tags":[],"title":"A Person Re-Identification System For Mobile Devices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["GA Cushen","MS Nixon"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1372654800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1372654800,"objectID":"2b4d919e3cf73dfcd0063c88fe01cb00","permalink":"/publication/clothing-search/","publishdate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/clothing-search/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a mobile visual clothing search system whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking photo or take a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a retail database. From the query image, the person is detected, clothing is segmented, and clothing features are extracted and quantized. The information is sent from the phone client to a server, where the feature vector of the query image is used to retrieve similar clothing products from online databases. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location. State of the art work focuses primarily on the recognition of a diverse range of clothing offline and pays little attention to practical applications. Evaluated on a challenging dataset, the system is relatively fast and achieves promising results.","tags":[],"title":"Mobile visual clothing search","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
