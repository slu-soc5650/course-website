The course docs are designed to provide a single place for accessing resources related to either the course as a whole or to specific lectures. If you find an error or omission, or have a suggestion, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/slu-soc5650/slu-soc5650.github.io/issues) and let me know the details. I want to make sure this is as user-friendly and informative as possible!

## Getting Started
These pages are primarily designed to help you get ready to take SOC 4650 or SOC 5650. Their material needs to be completed *before* the beginning of the semester. The [Course Software](/docs/course-software) page also can be used if you decide to set-up the course software on your own computer midway through the semester or have to set-up a new computer.

## Fundamentals
These reference pages cover materials that don't typically show up in textbooks. They'll be assigned as required readings over the first few weeks of the semester. They also serve as good references as the semester progresses and you find yourself needing reminders about certain basic skills like Markdown or how to format an `.Rmd` file for this course.

## Lectures
Each lecture has a page here that includes the primary topics, links to resources, an embedded slide deck, and (sometimes) additional notes about the material covered that day.

## Final Project
This is a landing page with links to final project resources, data, instructions, and a list of the final project due dates.

## Topics
There are two indices included in this section - a listing of all of the topic keywords, ArcGIS processes, and `R` functions that we cover throughout the semester and a listing of `R` packages used (with links to documentation and resources).
