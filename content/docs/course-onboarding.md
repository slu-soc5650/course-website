## Overview
Before you begin the semester, there are a number of things that you should do to help set yourself up for success. **All of the applicable sections below should be completed before our first class on January 14th.** Before you do *anything* else, though, you should read through the [**Syllabus**](https://slu-soc5650.github.io/syllabus). Make sure you have a good sense of what is *required* for the course. If you have questions, bring them to the first day of class!

## Account Signups
### Get Started with the Discussion Board
Discourse is an open source forum platform that we will be using this semester to stay in touch and host virutal office hours. You should recieve an email with registration information, and the site can be found [here](https://discuss.slu-ssds.org). Once you recieve the invitation and accept, you can update your profile by clicking on the profile icon in the upper right-hand corner and selecting the gear icon:

![](/images/discoursePreferences.png)

At a minimum, please fill out the `Name` field under `Account` with your preferred first and last name!

### Get Started with GitHub
The service that is hosting this website is called [GitHub](https://github.com/). GitHub is used by programmers, data scientists, and researchers for hosting computer code, data, and project materials (like websites). We will be using GitHub extensively this semester. You will need a free account, which you can sign up for one from GitHub's [homepage](https://github.com/). If you already have a GitHub account, you do not need a new one. 

Once you have a GitHub user name, send Chris a direct message via our [discussion board](https://discuss.slu-ssds.org) with it so that you can be added to the [SOC 4650 & SOC 5650 organization](https://github.com/slu-soc5650). Your direct message inbox can be found by clicking on the profile icon in the upper right-hand corner and selecting the envelope icon: 

![](/images/discourseMessages.png)

Chris's username on the discussion board is `chris.prener`.

After you have been added to the organization, you should find your assignments repository and check the **Issues** tab. There should be an open **Issue** describing how feedback will be disseminated this semester. Please read it and then *close the issue* so that we know you've seen it.

## Course Software
There are two options for *accessing* the course software, and some instructions for how *install* it. Please read through these options carefully and make the decision that is best for you.

### Options for Accessing Software
One option is to rely on the **computers in our classroom**, and - lucky you(!) - you get 24-hour access to Morrissey Hall for the semester. If you decide to go this route, you can go right to the [course software](/docs/course-software/) page to continue setting up your computer - you'll need to install just the specific `R` packages and GitHub Desktop. Details on the extent of setup required will be posted there since it is subject to change. Make sure you know how to use Windows File Explorer, especially if you are a regular macOS user.

Another option for accessing the software is to **use your own computer**. If you decide to go this route, please read the next subsection on computer prep, and then head over to the [course software](/docs/course-software/) page to continue setting up your computer. As long as you have a relatively new computer (within the last few years), you should have no problem using any of the applications for this class. 

### Computer Prep
If you are using **your own computer**, you should do the following before proceeding:

1. Make sure your operating system is up-to-date. If you are able, I would also recommend upgrading your computer to the most recent release of its operating system that the computer can run.
    - On macOS, you can do this through the [App Store](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201541) 
    - Both [Windows 7](https://www.dummies.com/computers/computer-networking/network-security/how-to-manually-check-for-windows-7-updates/) and [Windows 10](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027667/windows-update-windows-10) have system update tools.

2. We'll be sharing computer files throughout the semester, so you should ensure that you have functioning anti-virus software and that it is up-to-date. You can get Symantec EndPoint Protection anti-virus software for free from SLU. Go to "ITS Software Downloads" under "Tools" on [mySLU](https://myslu.slu.edu/tools).

3. You'll also need to download files, so you'll need to make sure you have at least **fifty gigabytes** free on your hard drive if you are installing ArcGIS Pro and at least **twenty gigabytes** free if you are not. If you're not sure how to check this, here are some instructions for [Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-check-free-hard-drive-space-in-windows-2619187) and [macOS](https://www.macworld.com/article/2972775/os-x/how-to-check-your-macs-free-hard-drive-space.html).
    - Options for de-cluttering include deleting files that are no longer needed, moving files to an external device, moving files to a cloud storage system, or upgrading the internal hard drive (may not be possible for macOS users and some Windows users).

4. Make sure you know how to access your computer's file management system.
  - On macOS, this means being comfortable with Finder.app for finding folders, making new ones, and opening files. Here are some tips for using Finder on recent versions of [macOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201732).
  - On Windows, this means being comfortable with Windows File Explorer for finding folders, making new ones, and opening files. Here are some tips for using File Explorer on [Windows 7](https://www.dummies.com/computers/operating-systems/windows-7/how-to-navigate-windows-7-with-windows-explorer/) or [Windows 10](https://www.dummies.com/computers/operating-systems/windows-10/how-does-file-explorer-work-in-windows-10/).

5. Head over to the [course software](/docs/course-software/) page to continue setting up your computer. 

## Get Access to Books
There are a number of different books required for this course. Each book has been selected to correspond with one or more of the course objectives. Please purchase copies of the first three books and decide if you would like a physical copy of the fourth:

1. Brewer, Cynthia. 2015. *Designing better Maps: A Guide for GIS users*. Redlands, CA: ESRI Press.
2. Gorr, Wilpen and Kristen Kurland. 2017. *GIS Tutorial 1 for ArcGIS Pro*. Redlands, CA: ESRI Press.
3. Wickham, Hadley and Garrett Grolemund. 2016. *R for data science*. Sebastopol, CA: Oâ€™Reilly. [Webbook Available](http://r4ds.had.co.nz).

All of the books are available in the bookstore. They can also be ordered online. If you would rather use e-books, those are acceptable for this course as well. The [**Reading List**](https://github.com/slu-soc5650/Core-Documents/blob/master/reading-list.pdf) includes the assigned readings for both the web and print versions of Wickham and Grolemund's *R for data science* (2016), and you are free to choose either version.

## Other Materials
The other item to *optionally* purchase is a 1.5" three-ring binder. While all course materials are available online, they are often easier to use if they are printed. Everyone will get handouts the first week so you can decide if you want to continue reciving hardcopies beyond the first lecture, or if you'd prefer to only have the digital copies. If you do opt-in to reciving the hardcopies, a biner will help keep things organized.

## Administrative Tasks
All students should complete the [Student Information Sheet](https://goo.gl/forms/7plVgjijZ4i042X52), which gives me some info about you and gives you the chance to let me know about any initial concerns you might have. It also contains a syllabus agreement, which confirms that you have read the [**Syllabus**](https://slu-soc5650.github.io/syllabus) and understand the course policies.

## Coursework
There are three pieces of coursework that you should complete: 

1. You should view two videos posted on the [Course Preview](/docs/course-preview/) page and check out the interactive map discussed in the first video.
2. You should complete the assigned reading (and if you want, the optional ones too) listed in the [**Syllabus**](http://slu-soc5650.github.io/syllabus/course-preview/).
3. You should complete [Lecture-01 Entry Ticket](/docs/course-preview/#lecture-01-entry-ticket), which asks a few short questions about the videos and interactive map.
4. You should complete the assigned readings for Lecture-01, which are listed in the [**Syllabus**](http://slu-soc5650.github.io/syllabus/lecture-01-course-introduction/).
5. Come to class stoked to make your first maps!
