{{< warning title="Updates Planned" >}}
Moderate revisions to the curriculum are planned for the next edition of the course. General topics will remain the same, but repos will be re-organized and additional resources will be provided. Existing resources should not be considered current if their date is for 2017.

## Course Description 
<img src="/images/logo.png" align="right" />
This class introduces both the theoretical and technical skills that constitute the nascent field of Geographic Information Science (GISc). Techniques introduced include data cleaning and management, map production and cartography, and the manipulation of both tabular and spatial data. The impacts of GISc on public policy, and the effects of public policy on GISc, are also discussed. The course incorporates a wide variety of social, economic, health, urban, meteorological, and environmental data. These data are mapped at a variety of extents, from the City of St. Louis to the St. Louis Metropolitan region, Missouri, all United States counties, and all U.S. states.[^1]

## Course Objectives
This course has six intertwined objectives:

1. *Geographic information science*: Describe the concepts that form the foundation of GISc.
2. *Data management*: Perform basic data cleaning tasks using `R`, construct geo-databases using ArcCatalog for data organization and storage, and modify that data using ArcMap's geoprocessing tools.
3. *Data visualization*: Create and present visualizations of spatial data using `R` and `ggplot2`, ArcMap, and other design tools.
4. *Analysis development*: Apply techniques that make GISc work more reproducible, accurate, and collaborative using GitHub, `R`, Markdown, and other tools.
5. *GISc and Public Policy*: Describe the ways in which public entities support GISc research and the ways in which GISc research supports public policy goals.
6. *Research synthesis*: Plan, implement, and present a research project that uses a large, publicly available spatial dataset of non-emergency service requests for the City of St. Louis.

## Acknowledgements
Like many things in academia, the "final" product here is the result of others' hard work as well as my own. I owe gratitude and thanks to [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz), whose data science tools are featured as part of this course. I also draw significant inspiration from [Jenny Bryan](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/), whose [Stat 545 course](http://stat545.com) has served as a significant resource and a model for my own teaching. 

This website itself is the product of [Yihui Xie's](https://yihui.name) work on the [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) package for `R` as well as [Digitalcraftsman's](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman) port of [Martin Donath's](https://github.com/squidfunk) [Material theme](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material).

Finally, I want to acknowledge my now eight semesters' worth of students in GIS as well as statistics, whose collective feedback and experiences have helped dramatically reshape the course content and how I teach. For example, the [topic](/topic-index/) and [package indexes](/package-index/) on this site are direct responses to student suggestions and feedback. I am immensely grateful for each of your contributions to my research methods courses.
