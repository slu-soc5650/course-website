## Course Description 
<img src="/images/logo.png" align="right" />
SOC 4650 & 5650 is Saint Louis University Sociology's undergraduate and graduate introductory GIS course, which is will next be taught for Spring 2018. This site is for sections taught by Assistant Professor Christopher Prener.  

This class introduces both the theoretical and technical skills that constitute the nascent field of Geographic Information Science (GISc). Techniques introduced include data cleaning and management, map production and cartography, and the manipulation of both tabular and spatial data. The impacts of GISc on public policy, and the effects of public policy on GISc, are also discussed. The course incorporates a wide variety of social, economic, health, urban, meteorological, and environmental data. These data are mapped at a variety of extents, from the City of St. Louis to the St. Louis Metropolitan region, Missouri, all United States counties, and all U.S. states.

## Course Objectives
This course has six intertwined objectives:

1. *Fundamentals of spatial data*: Describe the concepts and theories that form the foundation of GISc.
2. *Fundamentals of data management*: Perform basic data cleaning tasks using `R`, construct geo-databases using ArcCatalog for data organization and storage, and perform basic manipulations of that data using ArcMap.
3. *Fundamentals of data visualization*: Create and present visualizations of spatial data using `R` and `ggplot2`, ArcMap, and other design tools.
4. *Fundamentals of analysis development*: Apply techniques that make research more reproducible, accurate, and collaborative using GitHub, `R`, Markdown, and other tools.
5. *GISc and Public Policy*: Describe the ways in which public entities support GISc research and the ways in which GISc research supports public policy goals.
6. *Geospatial research synthesis*: Plan, implement, and present a research project that uses a large, publicly available spatial dataset of non-emergency service requests for the City of St. Louis.

{{< warning title="Syllabus Changes for Spring 2018" >}}
The syllabus and reading list for the course will be undergoing revision for Spring 2018. Several major aspects of the course will be changed, including the replacement of Stata content from prior semesters with R.

## Acknowledgements

Like many things in academia, the "final" product here is the result of others' hard work as well as my own. I owe gratitude and thanks to [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz), whose data science tools are featured as part of this course. I also draw significant inspiration from [Jenny Bryan](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/), whose [Stat 545 course](http://stat545.com) has served as a significant resource and a model for my own teaching. 

This website itself is the product of [Yihui Xie's](https://yihui.name) work on the [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) package for `R` as well as [Digitalcraftsman's](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman) port of [Martin Donath's](https://github.com/squidfunk) [Material theme](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material).

Finally, I want to acknowledge my now eight semesters' worth of students in GIS as well as statistics, whose collective feedback and experiences have helped dramatically reshape the course content and how I teach. I am immensely grateful for each of your contributions to my research methods courses.
