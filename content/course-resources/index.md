This page is meant to augment the core documents by providing easy access to online elements of the course. The [**Syllabus**](https://github.com/slu-soc5650/Core-Documents/blob/master/syllabus.pdf) contains a full list of resources, including those not available online.

## Core Documents
There are two documents for this course that spell out what is *required*:

* [**Syllabus**](https://github.com/slu-soc5650/Core-Documents/blob/master/syllabus.pdf)
* [**Reading List**](https://github.com/slu-soc5650/Core-Documents/blob/master/reading-list.pdf)

## Course Website
This [**course website**](https://slu-soc5650.github.io) will be updated regularly throughout the semester. I'll add a page on the menu for each week, and include links to lecture slides, YouTube videos, and notes about specific topics. The **course website** also contains specific pages for the [final project](/final-project/) and two index pages cataloguing [topics covered](/topic-index/) and [`R` packages used](/package-index/). Enteries on both index pages include links to the relevant week or weeks where the item is covered.

## Readings
Throughout the semester, there will be assigned readings from a number of different books. These include a number that you will have to buy (see the [**Syllabus**](https://github.com/slu-soc5650/Core-Documents/blob/master/syllabus.pdf) and the [Getting Started page](/getting-started/)) and some that you can access online. The books available online include:

* [*R for Data Science*](http://r4ds.had.co.nz)
* [*Data Visualization for Social Science*](http://socviz.co)
* [*Sociospatial Data Science*](https://chris-prener.github.io/SSDSBook/)

Other articles and chapters not included in these books will be posted on our course's [electronic reserves site](http://eres.slu.edu/eres/coursepage.aspx?cid=4444), and the password is posted in Slack on the `#helpdesk-coursework` channel. 

## GitHub
All course materials will be posted to repositories on our course [**GitHub Organization**](https://github.com/slu-soc5650). Each student will have their own private repository in the same organization for submitting course work.

## Slack
[**Slack**](https://slu-soc5650.slack.com) is a communication platform for groups. We'll use **Slack** this semester to stay in touch, provide updates on the course, and as a space for virtual office hours.
