In addition to the [**Syllabus**](https://github.com/slu-soc5050/Core-Documents/blob/master/syllabus.pdf) and the [**Reading List**](https://github.com/slu-soc5050/Core-Documents/blob/master/reading-list.pdf), there are a number of other course resources you should be aware of.

## Course Website
This [**course website**](https://slu-soc5050.github.io) will be updated regularly throughout the semester. I'll add a page on the menu for each week, and include links to lecture slides, YouTube videos, and notes about specific topics.

## User's Guide
The [**User's Guide**](https://slu-soc5050.github.io/User-Guide/index.html) is a companion document for the course that covers applications and processes not covered by one of the course textbooks.

## R for Data Science
Speaking of textbooks, the book [*R for Data Science*](http://r4ds.had.co.nz) is available for free online.

## Slack
[**Slack**](https://slu-soc5050.slack.com) is a communication platform for groups. We'll use **Slack** this semester to stay in touch, provide updates on the course, and as a space for virtual office hours.

## ShareLaTeX
[**ShareLaTeX**](https://www.sharelatex.com) is a Google Docs like web application for authoring LaTeX documents collaboratively. We'll use it this semester for several assignments as well as the final project.
