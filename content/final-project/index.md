## Overview

The final project for this course requires students to clean and map non-emergency call data from the City of St. Louis. These data describe the presence of various types of problems in City neighborhoods. The project brings together many of the scientific computing and GI science skills that are developed over the course of the semester. It also models the collaborative nature of GI science work by asking students to complete some aspects of the final project as a group using the collaborative development (GitHub) and communication (Slack) tools we have learned this semester. This guide contains instructions for completing the final project.
