Like many things in academia, the "final" product here is the result of others' hard work as well as my own. I owe gratitude and thanks to [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz) and [Edzer Pebesma](https://github.com/edzer), whose data science and GIS tools are featured as part of this course. I also draw significant inspiration from [Jenny Bryan](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/), whose [Stat 545 course](http://stat545.com) has served as a significant resource and a model for my own teaching.

This website itself is the product of [Yihui Xie's](https://yihui.name) work on the [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) package for `R` as well as [George Cushen's](https://georgecushen.com) [Academic theme](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/) for Hugo. 

Finally, I want to acknowledge my now eleven semesters' worth of students in GIS as well as statistics, whose collective feedback and experiences have helped dramatically reshape the course content and how I teach. For example, the [topic](/docs/topic-index/) and [package indexes](/docs/package-index/) on this site are direct responses to student suggestions and feedback. I am immensely grateful for each of your contributions to my research methods courses.
