I know a lot of you are worried about your coursework. How can you make the switch to distance learning overnight if you have no practice in it and don’t even know what it means? How will you continue to learn complicated and difficult software with dramatically reduced resources? Will your grades suffer with the shift to online teaching? How will you complete assignments? 

My goal for this page is to clarify, at least for the context of SOC 4650 and 5650, how things are going to change. I hope doing so reduces some of the ambiguity and stress related to this class and the rest of the semester.

## Focusing on What Matters
First, though, I think it is important to acknowledge the current situation we are all collectively facing outside of coursework. I assume that all of us are worried about lots of other things, too. This other stuff is huge, existential stuff - the still unknown scale of the CVOID-19 pandemic, the specter of a recession worst than the 2008 one, and the day-to-day unknown of when our lives will return to "normal." We’re literally worrying about our physical survival, our mental health, our family’s and friends’ lives, and maybe our family’s finances. Our lives have all been dramatically disrupted almost overnight. Some of us are still working, some of us are taking care of children or older adults, some of us are struggling to make ends meet. We should be honest with ourselves - this is an incredibly significant, stressful, and life-altering event we are all collectively experiencing.

**All of this takes precedence over a semester’s worth of college or graduate classes.** I want to make clear that we should not and cannot continue with coursework as though things are the same, but just online now. We can’t ignore the fact that we are living in a moment of uncertainty and crisis. This means we have to be kind to ourselves and each other. It also means all of us, but especially faculty, need drastically re-calibrate our expectations for what we will learn and achieve in courses this semester. This is important because (1) it’s just true (2) our mental health will suffer if we don’t acknowledge this and try to go on as if everything is normal. 

## Office Hours
One way in which I am going try and achieve some semblence of normalcy will be remaining available to you in variety of ways. My office hours will remain the same - Tuesdays, 9am to 11am by [appointment only](https://calendly.com/chris-prener) and 11am to 12pm. These will all occur via Zoom. If you sign-up for an appointment, I'll email you a link for our Zoom meeting. Details on the drop-in Zoom hour will be available via Google Classroom. Please feel free to stop by as often as you would like, and we can use a breakout room if necessary to speak privately. I'll also remain engaged on Slack, as will Carter. As always, I will also remain available via email.

## Policy Changes
Outside of office hours, how will this reality affect our class? I’m making some changes to what you’ll be expected to do and how you’ll be evaluated. My goal is to give you the opportunity to keep learning and engaging with me and each other, but without feeling that the class is a source of stress in your life now. The goal of these changes is to minimize your anxiety and stress while maximizing your opportunity to learn and stay engaged in our learning community.

  * **There will be no second half participation grade.** Everyone will receive full credit in that column, and I will no longer collect attendance. That said, coming to class remains an important part of the course. I will record class sessions using Zoom, but I can't guarantee they will work every time. It is also important to establish a routine for yourself, and to find ways to see other people even if it is only virtually. We're going to all get a lot less interaction with other people than we're used to, and so getting up and spending a little time engaged in coursework is going to be beneficial for our mental health.
  * **Class meetings will occur via Zoom, and will be shorter.** We will continue to meet Mondays at 4:15pm Central Time via Zoom. You will all receive an email shortly with an invitation that will be good for the remainder of the semester. We will conclude class around 6pm each day instead of the scheduled 7pm time. Recordings and class materials will continue to be made available via the course website and GitHub.
  * **There will be no more ArcGIS Pro work.** Unfortunately, not all of us have access to ArcGIS Pro without the lab (myself included). Therefore, there is no way for us to continue with course materials in a productive way. All of you who do have access to ArcGIS Pro will retain that access into the future, and are welcome to keep using it.
  * **Coursework will be modified, and there will be no more required readings.** There will be *four* more labs I ask you all to complete this semester, all using `R`. These will have reduced expectations. There will be *one* more problem set, again with reduced expectations, that covers the material in the four remaining labs. We'll also discuss an interactive map at the beginning of each of our remaining class sessions.
  * **The final project will be modified.** Students will be required to produce a `.html` file containing three interactive maps that illustrate some facet of their topic. At least one should be a demographic map, and the other two should focus on their topic data. Students enrolled in SOC 5650 should plan to include approximately 1,500 words of text in their interactive map document summarizing these maps and linking them to the peer-reviewed literature on their topic. An example document will be made available prior to our meeting on March 23rd, and this will be due May 12th by 5pm.
  
  ## Modified Schedule
We'll use the following modified schedule:

  * March 23rd - Check-in and COVID-19 Discussion
  * March 30th - Projections
    * Lab A due before next class
  * April 6th - Intersect and Aggregate Features
    * Lab B due before next class (on the 20th)
    * Draft of final project `.html` file due before next class (on the 20th)
  * April 13th - *No Class, Easter Break* 
    * continue to work on final projects
  * April 20th - Dissolve and Merge Features
    * Lab C due before next class
    * Final PS due before May 4th class
  * April 27th - Geocoding
    * Lab D due before next class
  * May 4th - Course Conclusion
  * May 12th - Final projects due by 5pm
  
## What Happens If I Get Sick?
If you become unwell, or find yourself taking care of your family or friends, please let me know as soon as possible! Even though I am not taking attendance, I want to make sure students are all well prepared for the final set of assignments. If "as soon as possible" is a few days after a deadline, that is OK. If you need to re-schedule the final project submission, that is OK too. I will not ask for documentation, since if you're sick but not *very* sick, the last thing most you will want to do is go to a doctor just to get a note. I am proceeding with a spirit of trust in all of you, and ask you reciprocate that with me. 

## Provisos
This is my plan as of March 20th, 2020. I may modify it further as we progress through the remainder of the semester. If I become sick or a member of my family becomes ill, further modifications will likely be required. I will do my best to keep everyone updated in a timely fashion. Please check your email and Slack regularly. I appreciate everyone's willingness to roll with the many punches we are all facing right now. Remember, we are in this together.
