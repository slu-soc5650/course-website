Before you begin the semester, there are a number of things that you should do to help set yourself up for success. **All of the applicable sections below should be completed before our first class on January 22nd.** Before you do *anything* else, though, you should read through the [**Syllabus**](https://github.com/slu-soc5650/Core-Documents/blob/master/syllabus.pdf) and the [**Reading List**](https://github.com/slu-soc5650/Core-Documents/blob/master/reading-list.pdf). Make sure you have a good sense of what is *required* for the course. If you have questions, bring them to the first day of class!

## Account Signups
### Get Started with Slack
We'll be using the messaging platform [Slack](https://slack.com) as a space for "virtual office hours". Slack is a messaging system used by teams of all kinds. If you can text, you can use Slack. You will need to sign-up for the SOC 5650 Slack organization [here](https://join.slack.com/t/slu-soc5650/signup). You will need to complete the signup process even if you use Slack for other purposes. Consider installing either the desktop or the mobile apps for Slack to keep in touch and receive push alerts!

### Get Started with GitHub
The website that is hosting this wiki is called [GitHub](https://github.com/). GitHub is used by programmers, data scientists, and researchers for hosting computer code, data, and project materials. We will be using GitHub extensively this semester. You will need a free account, which you can sign up for one from GitHub's [homepage](https://github.com/). If you already have a GitHub account, you do not need a new one. *Once you have a GitHub user name, send Chris a Direct Message via Slack with it so that you can be added to the SOC 5650 organization.*

## Get Started with Software
If you will be using your own computer in class, you'll want to install a number of applications. If you aren't using your own computer, you can skip this section! All of these applications are available in our classroom, and - lucky you(!) - you get 24-hour access to Morrissey Hall for the semester. So, no need to worry about software installations if you do not want to.

### Computer Prep
Before you install your software, you should do the following:

1. Make sure your operating system is up-to-date. If you are able, I would also recommend upgrading your computer to the most recent release of its operating system that the computer can run.

2. We'll be sharing computer files throughout the semester, so you should ensure that you have functioning anti-virus software and that it is up-to-date. You can get anti-virus software for free from SLU. Go to `ITS Software Downloads` under `Tools` on [mySLU](https://myslu.slu.edu/tools).

3. You'll also need to download files, so you'll need to make sure you have some free space on your hard drive. If you have less than 10GB of free space, you should de-clutter!

4. Make sure you know how to access your computer's file management system.
  - On macOS, this means being comfortable with Finder.app.
  - On Windows, this means being comfortable with Windows Explorer.

### Software Installation
Now that your computer is up-to-date, there are three applications that you will want to download:

1. The computing language `R` needs to be downloaded and installed. You can download it from the [`R`'s website](https://cloud.r-project.org). Choose "Download R for (Mac) OS X" or "Download R for Windows". Windows users should look for a link that says "install R for the first time". Both macOS and Windows users should install `R` version 3.4.3, known as "Kite Eating Tree".[^1] **If you already have `R` installed on your computer, make sure you are running version 3.4.3.**

2. RStudio is a graphical user interface for `R` that will make learning the language and using it much, much easier. You should download the *free* version of RStudio from [their website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). Choose the appropirate installer for your platform. **If you already have RStudio installed on your computer, make sure you are running version 1.1.383.**

3. GitHub Desktop is a client for interacting with GitHub that makes downloading and uploading files a breeze. You can download it from the developer's [website](http://desktop.github.com).

### ArcGIS
Additionally, you will want to decide if you want to run ArcGIS on your computer. ArcGIS requires Microsoft Windows, which means that you need a Windows computer or an Apple computer *with Windows installed*. ESRI, the company that makes ArcGIS, also maintains a list of the [system requirements](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/get-started/system-requirements/arcgis-desktop-system-requirements.htm) that your computer must meet. If your computer meets these requirements and you would like a student license for ArcGIS, send Chris a direct message on Slack asking for a license. Student licenses are good for one year, and are free!

If you have an Apple computer, make sure it [meets Microsoft 10's requirements](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-specifications) before purchasing any software. You will need a *minimum* of 50 GB of free space on your hard drive in my experience. Go to the Apple Menu, and then choose `About this Mac > Storage` to check out how much space you have free.

Installing Windows on an Apple computer requires two pieces:

1. You need a Windows license, which you can purchase through [Microsoft's education program](http://www.onthehub.com/microsoft-windows-10-education-for-students/?utm_source=ms-student-page&utm_medium=microsoft-site&utm_campaign=windows10) for $9.95
2. You need a means for installing Windows on your Mac. You can use Apple's [Bootcamp](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201468), which is free but requires you to boot up in either Windows *or* macOS, or you can buy a [Parallels Desktop for Mac](https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/) license that allows you to use Windows and macOS simultaneously. Parallels can be purchased at a 50% discount through their [Student Edition program](http://onthehub.com/parallels/). The Student Edition costs $39.99 per year. 

All told, you can get ArcGIS running on your Mac for between $10 and $50 for the semester. Set-up takes a couple of hours, so be prepared for a time investment to get this up and running. I also strongly recommend backing up your entire computer using Apple's [Time Machine](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250) before making a large change to your system like this.[^2]

## Get Access to Books
There are a number of different books required for this course. Each book has been selected to correspond with one or more of the course objectives. **Before January 22nd**, please purchase copies of the first three books and decide if you would like a physical copy of the fourth:

1. Brewer, Cynthia. 2015. *Designing better Maps: A Guide for GIS users*. Redlands, CA: ESRI Press.
2. Gorr, Wilpen and Kristen Kurland. 2016. *GIS Tutorial 1: Basic Workbook for ArcGIS 10.3.x*. Redlands, CA: ESRI Press.
3. Thomas, Christopher and Nancy Humenik-Sappington. 2009. *GIS for decision support and public policy making*. Redlands, CA: ESRI Press.
4. Wickham, Hadley and Garrett Grolemund. 2016. *R for data science*. Sebastopol, CA: Oâ€™Reilly. [Webbook Available](http://r4ds.had.co.nz).

All of the books are available in the bookstore. They can also be ordered online. If you would rather use e-books, those are acceptable for this course as well. The [**Reading List**](https://github.com/slu-soc5650/Core-Documents/blob/master/reading-list.pdf) includes the assigned readings for both the web and print versions of Wickham and Grolemund's *R for data science* (2016), and you are free to choose either version.

## Administrative Tasks
All students should complete the [Student Information Sheet](https://goo.gl/forms/7xR7i5n40ROl1YlH3), which gives me some info about you and gives you the chance to let me know about any initial concerns you might have. It also contains a syllabus agreement, which confirms that you have read the [**Syllabus**](https://github.com/slu-soc5650/Core-Documents/blob/master/syllabus.pdf) and understand the course policies. The should be completed before class on January 22nd.

## Coursework
There are three pieces of coursework that you should **complete before January 22nd**: 

1. You should view two videos posted on the [Preview Week](/preview-week/) page and check out the interactive map dicussed in the first video.
2. You should complete [Weekly Prep 01](/preview-week/#weekly-prep-01), which asks a few short questions about the videos and interactive map.
3. You should complete the assigned readings for Week-01, which are listed in the [**Reading List**](https://github.com/slu-soc5650/Core-Documents/blob/master/reading-list.pdf) and are available through [electronic reserves site](http://eres.slu.edu/eres/coursepage.aspx?cid=4444).

[^1]: All of `R`'s version names are taken from the [Peanuts comic strip](http://livefreeordichotomize.com/2017/09/28/r-release-names/).

[^2]: Using [Time Machine](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250) is a good practice anyway!
