Before you begin the semester, there are a number of things that I recommend that you do to help set yourself up for success. Before you do *anything* else, you should read through the [**Syllabus**](https://github.com/slu-soc5050/Core-Documents/blob/master/syllabus.pdf) and the [**Reading List**](https://github.com/slu-soc5050/Core-Documents/blob/master/reading-list.pdf). Make sure you have a good sense of what is *required* for the course. If you have questions, bring them to the first day of class!

## Account Signups
### Get Started with Slack
We'll be using the messaging platform [Slack](https://slack.com) as a space for "virtual office hours". Slack is a messaging system used by teams of all kinds. If you can text, you can use Slack. You will need to sign-up for the SOC 5050 Slack organization [here](https://join.slack.com/t/slu-soc5050/signup). You will need to complete the signup process even if you use Slack for other purposes. Consider installing either the desktop or the mobile apps for Slack to keep in touch and receive push alerts!

### Get Started with GitHub
The website that is hosting this wiki is called [GitHub](https://github.com/). GitHub is used by programmers, data scientists, and researchers for hosting computer code, data, and project materials. We will be using GitHub extensively this semester. You will need a free account, which you can sign up for one from GitHub's [homepage](https://github.com/). If you already have a GitHub account, you do not need a new one. *Once you have a GitHub user name, send Chris a Direct Message via Slack with it so that you can be added to the SOC 5050 organization.*

### Get Started with LaTeX
We'll be doing a little bit of writing using LaTeX, which is a markup language that makes technical writing easier. We'll be using  [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com) this semester for this purpose. ShareLaTeX is a bit like Google Docs, but for LaTeX. It is a "freemium" service - please don't pay for any additional features - you won't need them! You can sign-up for ShareLaTeX on their [website](https://www.sharelatex.com).

## Get Started with Software
If you will be using your own computer in class, you'll want to install a number of applications. If you aren't using your own computer, you can skip this section! All of these applications are available in our classroom, and - lucky you - you get 24-hour access to Morrissey Hall for the semester.

### Computer Prep
Before you install your software, you should do the following:

1. Make sure your operating system is up-to-date. If you are able, I would also recommend upgrading your computer to the most recent release of its operating system that the computer can run.

2. We'll be sharing computer files throughout the semester, so you should ensure that you have functioning anti-virus software and that it is up-to-date. You can get anti-virus software for free from SLU. Go to `ITS Software Downloads` under `Tools` on [mySLU](https://myslu.slu.edu/tools).

3. You'll also need to download files, so you'll need to make sure you have some free space on your hard drive. If you have less than 10GB of free space, you should de-clutter!

4. Make sure you know how to access your computer's file management system.
  - On macOS, this means being comfortable with Finder.app.
  - On Windows, this means being comfortable with Windows Explorer.

### Software Installation
Now that your computer is up-to-date

1. The computing language `R` needs to be downloaded and installed. You can download it from the [University of California-Berkeley](https://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu). Choose "Download R for (Mac) OS X" or "Download R for Windows".

2. RStudio is a graphical user interface for `R` that will make learning the language and using it much, much easier. You should download the *free* version of RStudio from [their website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). Choose the installer for your platform, and ping me on Slack if you have any questions.

3. GitHub Desktop is a client for interacting with GitHub that makes downloading and uploading files a breeze. You can download it from the developer's [website](http://desktop.github.com).

4. Atom is a text editor that is produced by the same folks who operate GitHub. Download Atom from the developer's [website](http://atom.io).

## Get Access to Books
### Books
There are three books required for this course. Each book has been selected to correspond with one or more of the course objectives. The books are:

1. Freedman, David, Robert Pisani, and Roger Purves. 2007. *Statistics*. 4th edition. New York, NY: W.W. Norton and Company.

2. Wheelan, Charles. 2014. *Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data*. New York, NY: W.W. Norton and Company.

3. Wickham, Hadley and Garrett Grolemund. 2016. *R for data science*. Sebastopol, CA: Oâ€™Reilly. [Webbook Available](http://r4ds.had.co.nz).

All of the books are available in the bookstore. They can also be ordered online. If you would rather use ebooks, those are acceptable for this course as well.

### Check Out the Readings for Week 01
All but one of the Week 01 readings are available on our course's [electronic reserves site](http://eres.slu.edu/eres/coursepass.aspx?cid=4487), and the password is posted in Slack on the `#helpdesk-coursework` channel. The initial section of Wickham and Grolemund can be found via the [webbook](http://r4ds.had.co.nz).

## Administrative Tasks
There are two forms that all students must fill out by Tuesday, September 5th:

1. the [Student Information Sheet](https://goo.gl/forms/HddqLWd00qz6Qs903), which gives me some info about you and gives you the chance to let me know about any initial concerns you might have.

2. the un-graded [Diagnostic Assessment](https://goo.gl/forms/EgVGaUWu8mys2yBr2), which is designed to get a sense of where each student's math skills are currently. Please don't consult outside materials as you do this - if you are not sure how to answer, make the most educated guess you can and move on. If you look answers up it defeats the purpose of this exercise!
