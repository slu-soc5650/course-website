R packages will need be installed both in the lab and on personal computers.

There are a number of `R` packages that you will need for this semester. If you feel feel comfortable, go ahead and take care of this before the semester starts. If not, we'll go over how to do this type of installation on the first day of class!

The following code snipped can be pasted into your `R` console to install all of these required packages.

```
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "janitor", "sf", 
    "testDriveR"))
```

Depending on your version of `R` and your operating system, there will be other dependencies that are required and the number of packages installed will be considerably larger. The installation process has not been extensively tested on different operating system and hardware configurations, and though it is unlikely, you may encounter issues. If you do, please let Chris know!
