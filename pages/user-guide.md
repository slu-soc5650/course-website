### Preface
As outlined in the [syllabus](https://github.com/slu-soc5050/Core-Documents/blob/master/syllabus.pdf), the Course User's Guide is meant to be a companion document to the course designed to help students be successful not just in the course but in research more generally. I originally envisioned this as a `.pdf` file that would accompany the [**Syllabus**](https://github.com/slu-soc5050/Core-Documents/blob/master/syllabus.pdf) and the [**Reading List**](https://github.com/slu-soc5050/Core-Documents/blob/master/reading-list.pdf). In working on it over the first couple of weeks, however, it has become clear that this is a document that is going to evolve over the course of the semester. I am therefore planning to publish it in sections directly ~~to the `Core-Documents` [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/slu-soc5050/Core-Documents)~~ to the [course website](http://slu-soc5050.github.io). This will better facilitate a 'living' document that can grow and develop over the course of the semester. I will keep the class updated as work on this document progresses. If you have feedback, comments, or suggestions, please let me know!
