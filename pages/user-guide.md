### Preface
As outlined in the [syllabus](https://github.com/slu-soc5650/Core-Documents/blob/master/syllabus.pdf), the Course User's Guide is meant to be a companion document to the course designed to help students be successful not just in the course but in research more generally. This is a 'living' document that will grow and develop over the course of the semester. I will keep the class updated as work on this document progresses. If you have feedback, comments, or suggestions, please let me know!
